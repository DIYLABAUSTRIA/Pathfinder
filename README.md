It's a cinematic GoPro Hero carrier, designed for easy build and maintenance as well as slow and steady cinematic flights.

#Hardware
+ CFK Top Plate
+ CFK Bottom Plate
+ 16x M3x20 standoff
+ 32x M3x10 Screw

#Printed parts
+ Ducts
+ Duct_foam

Ducts can be printed in PLA, ABS, PETG, etc..
Ducts_foam can either:
 +  minimal infill TPU print (2-5% for weight)
 +  CNC cut out of Foam you find fitting

#Electronics
I personally use 6S Electronics, but thats also a 2 year old build and there might be better options by now..


Everything else, drone ahead! ðŸš€

Please Note:
This was my very first Fusion 360 Project (I started over 4 times) so Im not proud of the Source file, still is attached for anyone to use.
